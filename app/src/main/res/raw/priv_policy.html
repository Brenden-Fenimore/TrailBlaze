<p class=MsoNormal>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: We only process your personal information when we
believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to
do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to
provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations,

<p class=MsoNormal>If you <a name="_Int_q4cpZALs">are located in</a> Canada,

<p class=MsoNormal>We may process your information if you have given us

<p class=MsoNormal>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: We may share information <a name="_Int_th03edsQ">in</a>
specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third
parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may need to share your personal information in the
following situations:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets,

company.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs. We may share your
information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API,
Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your
location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve
accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps
provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise. We obtain and store
on your device (&quot;cache&quot;) your location. You may revoke your consent
anytime by contacting us at the contact details provided at the end of this
document.</p>

appear in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data,
such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies
to collect and store your information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like
web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our
Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of
our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also permit third parties and service providers to use
online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising,
including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements
to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on
your communication preferences). <a name="_Int_Q6ozojP8">The third</a> parties
and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about
products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our
Services or on other websites.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed
to be a &quot;sale&quot;/&quot;sharing&quot; (which includes targeted
advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state
laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a
request as described below under section &quot;DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE
SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Specific information about how we use such technologies and
how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Google Analytics</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may share your information with Google Analytics to track
and analyze the use of the Services. To opt out of being tracked by Google
Analytics across the Services, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
For more information on the privacy practices of Google, please visit the
Google Privacy &amp; Terms page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our
Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain
information about you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in
using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X
logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
information about you from your social media provider. The profile information
we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will
often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media
platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes
that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to
you <a name="_Int_iVPxV3ak">on</a> the relevant Services. Please note that we
do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you
review their privacy <a name="_Int_rQsKaY2C">notice</a> to understand how they
collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your
privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary
to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise
required by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will only keep your personal information for as long as
it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a
longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
accounting, or other legal</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to
keep your personal information for longer than twelve (12) months past the
termination of the user's account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process
your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information,
or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information
through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect,
access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
within a secure environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from <a
name="_Int_Wvg75r0P">or</a> market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to
children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal
information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or
that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor
dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
records. If you become aware of any <a name="_Int_ty4UDp2B">data</a> we may
have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at TBD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or
in some regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access
to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or
state of residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under
applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request
access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request
rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information:
(iv) if applicable, to data </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated
decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to
object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a
request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
&quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
applicable data protection laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent
to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied
consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your
consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us
by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU CONTACT
US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, please note that this will not affect the
lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law
allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You
can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time
by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, replying
&quot;STOP&quot; or &quot;UNSUBSCRIBE&quot; to the SMS messages that we send,
or by contacting us using the details provided in the section &quot;HOW CAN YOU
CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?&quot; below. You will then be removed from the
marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you—for example, to
send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and
use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Account Information</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you would at any time like to review or change the
information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='text-indent:-.25in'><span style='font-family:
Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate
or delete your</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>account and information from our active databases. However,
we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply
with applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights,
you may email us at <a href="mailto:info@trailblaze.com">info@trailblaze.com</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and
mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting
you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
Privacy Notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to
web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal
standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at
this time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>12. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or
Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about
the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it,
correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information. You
may also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your
personal information. These rights may be limited in some circumstances by applicable
law. More information is provided below.</p>
