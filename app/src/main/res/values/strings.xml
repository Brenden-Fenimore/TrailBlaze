    <string name="phoneNumber">Phone Number</string>
    <string name="water">Stay hydrated: Dehydration can be a serious health problem, so bring more water than you think
        youll need. Use a durable water bottle to ensure you have access to clean water.
    </string>
    <string name="boots">Wear proper footwear: Wear quality closed-toe shoes with good cushioning and grip to avoid sore
        feet and ankle injuries.
    </string>
    <string name="layers">Dress in layers: Wear clothes that work for the weather and avoid cotton.</string>
    <string name="flashligh">Carry essentials: Bring a flashlight, matches, emergency shelter, and extra food and
        water.
    </string>
    <string name="limits">Know your limits: Be aware of your physical abilities and listen to your body. Recognize signs
        of fatigue or distress, such as shortness of breath or dizziness.
    </string>
    <string name="markedtrail">Stay on marked trails: Making shortcuts can lead to erosion and increase your chances of
        getting lost.
    </string>
    <string name="waterfalls">Dont climb on waterfalls: Falls from waterfalls and wet rocks can cause serious injuries
        and deaths.
    </string>
    <string name="whistle">Use a whistle: A whistle can be heard from far away and takes less energy than yelling.
    </string>
    <string name="phone">Dont rely on cell phones: Dont count on cell phones to work in the wilderness.</string>
    <string name="animal">Never feed or touch wildlife: Do not approach or attempt to move sick or injured wildlife.
        Please report any encounters with aggressive, sick or injured animals to a park staff.
    </string>
    <string name="bear">Wildlife lives in all state parks, even near urban areas: Although rare, black bears, mountain
        lions and rattlesnakes may be seen. If you encounter wildlife on the trail, keep your distance, back away slowly
        and do not run. Report your sightings to park staff.
    </string>
    <string name="ticks">Ticks: Tick populations can increase depending on the season. Take the following precautions
        to avoid them:
        Walk in the middle of trails. Use insect repellent. Tuck your pants into your socks. After taking off gear,
        check for hitchhiking ticks. Always do a “tick check” with the help of a friend.
    </string>
    <string name="poisonivy">Poison oak: It is a common plant throughout much of California. Learn to identify its
        shiny, three-leaf pattern, and avoid touching it. If you touch poison oak, wash immediately with water and mild
        soap. Pat dry with a clean towel.
    </string>
    <string name="fun">But mostly have fun! Enjoy nature! Love yourself. And remember leave only footprints, and take
        only memories!
    </string>

    <string name="snakes">Snakes: Always know where you are stepping. For example, if you must traverse a log that has
        fallen across the trail, rather than just stepping over the log, first step up onto the log then step down once
        you know the coast is clear. Be cautious when climbing rocks or picking up firewood. If you see a snake,
        maintain a distance of at least 6 feet. Most bites occur when people get too close or try to touch them.
